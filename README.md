Description: 
Refactoring existing code to meet a set of accessibility standards for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

Status: 

Complete. 
Additional items may be required as the project develops. At this time there are no planned changes but open to scale.

Basic HTML and CSS principles applied to meet accessibility standards by considering the following:

    1. Source code has semantic HTML elements
    2. Structure of HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
    3. Icon and image elements have accessible alt attribute.
    4. Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
    5. Title element has been made concise and descriptive.

Should modifications need to be made, changes inquiries should be made through the dev-ops manager of Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web **accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business&mdash;for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

Accessibility can include complex requirements, but your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria for this project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.
